# Meal Planning Application
React Framework and Firebase

This application will allow the user to easily create and track their meal plan by allowing them to search recipes from popular recipe sites to add to their recipe book, or enter their own recipes from other sources. By storing their favorite and previously used recipes, they will be able to more easily build a meal plan in the future.
